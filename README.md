# Wheel Game
This was a fun little experiment in HTML5 game development. I used used [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework because its fast, free, open-source and has a ton documentation. I had a lot of fun learning to define several game states like, booting up and preloading of assets such as audio, images, fonts, etc. Interacting with canvas elements and Phaser API was a breeze. Tweening kind of reminds me of [GSAP](https://greensock.com/).
